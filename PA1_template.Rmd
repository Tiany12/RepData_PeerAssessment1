## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{Read data}
unzip("activity.zip")
activity = read.csv("activity.csv")
file.remove("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Caluculate the total number of steps per day
```{Total number}
dailysteps <- aggergate(activity$steps, by =list(activity$date), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Make a histogram
```{Histogram}
colnames(dailysteps) <- c("date","steps")
hist(dailysteps$steps,main = "Daily Steps", xlab = "Number of steps")
```
Calculate the mean and median of total number of steps taken per day
```{Calculate}
mean(dailysteps$steps)
median(dailysteps$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{Make a time-series plot}
dailyactivity <- aggregate(activity$steps,by = list(activity$interval),FUN = mean,na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(dailyactivity) = c("interval","steps")
plot(dailyactivity$interval, dailyactivity$steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{Find max}
dailyactivity$interval[which.max(dailyactivity$steps)]
```



## Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```{Calculate}
nrow(activity) - sum(complete.cases(activity))
```
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
```{Fill in all missing value}
FillInInterval <- function(interval){
avg = dailyactivity[(interval/5)+1,2]
ifelse(is.na(avg),0,avg)
}
```
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{Create a new data set}
completeactivity<- activity
completeactivity$steps <- ifelse(
    is.na(activity$steps),FillInInterval(activity$interval),activity$steps
  )
```
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{Make a histogram}
completedailysteps <- aggregate(completeactivity$steps,by = list(completeactivity$date),FUN = sum)
colnames(completedailysteps) <- c("date","steps")
hist(completedailysteps$steps,main = "Daily Steps (Imputed data)",xlab = "Number of steps")
mean(completedailysteps$steps)
median(completedailysteps$steps)
```
The mean is greater and the median is the same
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
